/// The `Signal` type is an empty value type intended to act like the `Void` type but with the ability to be distinguishable
/// (`Hashable`) from other instances of itself.
///
/// The motivation for this type is to enable systems that utilize diffing algorithms to be able
/// to intercept this type instead of `Void`, which is not distinct accross instances, so that a change or event can be recognized through
/// reactive frameworks like `Combine`.
///
/// - warning: This is intended to be an uninhabited type. You can add transforms but **do not add properties** to it.

/// used in server-side development. They are essentially used to inject content of your own choosing while ignoring the incoming

/// where).
